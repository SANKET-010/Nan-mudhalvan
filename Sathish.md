**Project Title: Enhancing Public Transportation with**

**Data Analysis**

Introduction

The goal of this project is to leverage public transportation data to evaluate service

efficiency, on-time performance, and passenger feedback, ultimately improving the

overall public transportation experience. This document outlines the design thinking

process for the project, including analysis objectives, data collection methods,

visualization strategies, and code integration.

Data Collection

To achieve the project objectives, we will need to collect data from various sources:

1\. **Transportation Schedules**: Obtain schedules and timetables for public

transportation services. This data will help in assessing on-time performance.

2\. **Real-Time Updates**: Gather real-time data, including GPS tracking, to monitor

the actual movements of vehicles and identify delays or deviations from

schedules.

Visualization Strategy

To effectively communicate insights, we will use IBM Cognos for data visualization.

Here's the strategy for creating informative dashboards and reports:

1\. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Design dashboards displaying KPIs related

to on-time performance, passenger satisfaction, and service efficiency. These KPIs

will provide a quick overview of the state of public transportation.

2\. **Time-Series Visualizations**: Utilize line charts and time-series plots to visualize

trends in on-time performance. Highlight days or time slots with the highest

delays
